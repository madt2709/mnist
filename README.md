# MNIST

Classification of MNIST Dreams with simple convolution neural network. 

The model was trained on MNIST data set. The model was then tested on high-resolution images generated by a mixture of CPPN, GAN, VAE. See [this blog](https://blog.otoro.net/2016/04/01/generating-large-images-from-latent-vectors/) post by hardmaru for the source data and a description of how these morphed animations are generated.
